## Sub-theme starter installation

1. Copy the `STARTER` directory out of the starttr/ directory, and rename it to
   your theme name, so you will create a sub-theme.

   For example copy `sites/all/theme/starttr/STARTER` to 
   `sites/all/themes/STARTER` and rename it to `mytheme`

2. Edit `STARTER.info.yml' and change each `STARTER` word to your theme name

   Example: 
   `name: mytheme`

3. Rename `STARTER.info.yml` to your theme name, ex. `mytheme.info.yml`
4. Rename `STARTER.libraries.yml` to your theme name as before, ex.
   `mytheme.libraries.yml`
5. Go to appearance page (`admin/appearance`), install your theme, and set as
   default.
6. It's all! Now improve this sub-theme and make something amazing.
