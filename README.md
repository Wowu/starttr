# Starttr
Simple blog starter theme for Drupal 8

## About
Starttr is simple blog starter theme, what means, that you can completely modify
it. Comparing to other starter themes, starttr is just a couple of files like
normalize.css, basic styling, simple grid and responsive menu, so it is not necessary to use
this theme for a sub-theme.

## Installation
Starttr is created to be your own theme rather than 'starttr', so to change the
name of theme follow this steps:

  - unpack zip file or clone repo to your themes directory, usually
    `PATH_TO_DRUPAL/sites/all/themes/`
  - go to administrator page on your Drupal site and go to Appearance. Now
    install the theme (for more information visit
    https://drupal.org/getting-started/install-contrib/themes)
  - go to `STARTER/README.txt` to create your sub-theme
